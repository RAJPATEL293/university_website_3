      At TAMUCC, the main goal of the learning community is to demonstrate how different subjects integrate into students' career goals. The concept of integration, as in calculus, involves summing up tiny pieces into a single form. This idea applies to integrative learning, which involves summing up everything we learn from math, physics, and coding into a cohesive whole. Every course directly or indirectly intersects with students' majors. So far, different subjects have been useful in pushing my computing understanding and skills to the next level.

      The first thing I did this semester was to create my own website. During the university seminar class, we were introduced to various platforms such as WordPress, Weebly, Wix, Webstarts, and Google Sites, but I decided to code my own website. I always wondered how websites work and how they are linked together. When I saw that we had to develop our own website, I decided to use HTML & CSS even though I had no prior experience with these languages. At first, I found it confusing as I was unfamiliar with both languages, but after understanding some basic concepts about HTML and CSS, it became much easier. Once I created my homepage, I decided to make all my web pages look similar, which reduced one-third of my coding efforts. This allowed me to focus more on positioning and accurately arranging text and images so that they wouldn't overlap with each other. However, during my second submission, my text was overlapping with my activity images, which was very frustrating. But in my third submission, I made some edits to ensure that the text did not overlap or hover on the images.

      I consider the University Seminar to be the most effective class because the assigned projects help in better understanding programming languages. For example, last year, we created a text-based interview game for first-year students where interview questions were asked, and points were given as per user response. I boosted my skills in searching algorithms and making images on the console. We used ASCII values to make our code attractive, along with interview questions.
    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">This time, we were assigned a client whose requirements needed to be fulfilled. The major requirement from our client was to develop a ticket management system that manages the ticket handling process, saves information, and tracks the ticket in real-time. We started this project as soon as we completed our first meeting. The task was huge, but this time, I wanted to do something different. So, my fellow team members and I did a lot of googling to find the best way to tackle this task.</p>
      <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">We took our project to the next level by developing a GUI that can help people who have no experience in programming languages to enter and manipulate tickets. The GUI interface helps users navigate, just like using any mobile or desktop application. Additionally, before getting access to alter the ticket, users need to go through a login phase where only authorized persons will get access.</p>
      <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">All of this is integrated with the Database, where each entered information is updated on the server in real-time. The database is fully encrypted, which helps to keep user data secure and protect it from unauthorized persons.</p>

        This spring, I am taking a cybersecurity class where most of the lectures are based on algorithms that help to protect data. It gives an overview of how messages and data are manipulated and protected from theft. I get to know what things are involved during a single motion of sending a message from my phone to a receiver. That is useful information for me as a system programmer. Keeping user data secure is not only a necessary thing, but also a lawful thing. During one lecture, we exchanged views on databases, which later on was very useful for developing my capstone project. I learned about how databases work, how data is fetched into the database, the arrangement, and implementation. One thing that I remember was that data is arranged into tables where each new input is stored into a new row. So basically, it stores the information in real-time, into rows and columns. This was later useful for storing ticket information of new users in real-time for the project. We combined our GUI page with the database to track and manipulate information in real-time.

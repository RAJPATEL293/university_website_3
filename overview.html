      At TAMUCC, the main goal of the learning community is to demonstrate how different subjects integrate into students' career goals. The concept of integration, as in calculus, involves summing up tiny pieces into a single form. This idea applies to integrative learning, which involves summing up everything we learn from math, physics, and coding into a cohesive whole. Every course directly or indirectly intersects with students' majors. So far, different subjects have been useful in pushing my computing understanding and skills to the next level.

      As a computer science student, we often have to explore advanced topics in coding on our own, such as threading, multiprocessing, and basic GUI. There is always more to learn to become a proficient computer scientist, or what some call a "brogrammer." This semester, I learned Python as my third coding language, after C and C++. It was my first time switching to another language on my own. As we all know, Python has one of the most extensive collections of open-source modules that can help create apps, games, website backends, and AI. To start exploring the more complex aspects of coding is a significant achievement for me. I learned about several essential tools that we use all the time, like graphical interfaces, which helped me create my FYI project successfully. I also learned about integrating SQL (an online database) into our code to exchange data in real-time and plus multithreading and multiprocessing, where more than one process can take place simultaneously. I am eager to take Python to the next level and learn in-depth concepts and their practical applications during the summer break.

      I consider the University Seminar to be the most effective class because the assigned projects help in better understanding programming languages. For example, last year, we created a text-based interview game for first-year students where interview questions were asked, and points were given as per user response. I boosted my skills in searching algorithms and making images on the console. We used ASCII values to make our code attractive, along with interview questions.
    <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">This time, we were assigned a client whose requirements needed to be fulfilled. The major requirement from our client was to develop a ticket management system that manages the ticket handling process, saves information, and tracks the ticket in real-time. We started this project as soon as we completed our first meeting. The task was huge, but this time, I wanted to do something different. So, my fellow team members and I did a lot of googling to find the best way to tackle this task.</p>
      <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">We took our project to the next level by developing a GUI that can help people who have no experience in programming languages to enter and manipulate tickets. The GUI interface helps users navigate, just like using any mobile or desktop application. Additionally, before getting access to alter the ticket, users need to go through a login phase where only authorized persons will get access.</p>
      <p style="font-size: larger; padding-left: 10%; padding-right: 10%;">All of this is integrated with the Database, where each entered information is updated on the server in real-time. The database is fully encrypted, which helps to keep user data secure and protect it from unauthorized persons.</p>

        This spring, I am taking a cybersecurity class where most of the lectures are based on algorithms that help to protect data. It gives an overview of how messages and data are manipulated and protected from theft. I get to know what things are involved during a single motion of sending a message from my phone to a receiver. That is useful information for me as a system programmer. Keeping user data secure is not only a necessary thing, but also a lawful thing. During one lecture, we exchanged views on databases, which later on was very useful for developing my capstone project. I learned about how databases work, how data is fetched into the database, the arrangement, and implementation. One thing that I remember was that data is arranged into tables where each new input is stored into a new row. So basically, it stores the information in real-time, into rows and columns. This was later useful for storing ticket information of new users in real-time for the project. We combined our GUI page with the database to track and manipulate information in real-time.

        What matters to big firms? How information is stored, and how to capture and secure data from websites and applications are all crucial questions that arise while learning about Database Management Systems in Cyber Security. This course taught me that data is incredibly valuable, and being able to manipulate and store it is a vital job for programmers. That's why I decided to learn MySql language for database management, which was the best move I made this semester. The major problem we faced while working on the FYI project was storing and manipulating student information, which we tackled easily with my basic knowledge of databases and online servers.
        <br>
        To enhance my skills, I started following CS50, a free online course from Harvard. Since I am learning on my own, I can stretch my limits as much as I want. Currently, I am learning the basic features and concepts of database management. Later on, I plan to learn about data visualization and data mining, where these concepts will serve as my foundation for building a better career.
